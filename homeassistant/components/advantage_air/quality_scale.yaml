      Add mock_setup_entry common fixture.
      Test unique_id of the entry in happy flow.
      Split duplicate entry test from happy flow, use mock_config_entry.
      Error flow should end in CREATE_ENTRY to test recovery.
      Add data_description for ip_address (and port) to strings.json - tests fail with:
      "Translation not found for advantage_air: config.step.user.data_description.ip_address"

      Patch the library instead of mocking at integration level.
      Split binary sensor tests into multiple tests (enable entities etc).
      Split tests into Creation (right entities with right values), Actions (right library calls), and Other behaviors.
