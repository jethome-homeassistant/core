      Stale docstring and test name: `test_form_home` and reusing result.
      Extract `async_setup_entry` into own fixture.
      Avoid importing `config_flow` in tests.

      The config flow misses data descriptions.
      Make use of Electricity Maps zone keys in country code as dropdown.
      Make use of location selector for coordinates.

      Use `hass.config_entries.async_setup` instead of assert await `async_setup_component(hass, DOMAIN, {})`
