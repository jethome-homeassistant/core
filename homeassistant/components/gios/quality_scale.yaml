      We should have the happy flow as the first test, which can be merged with test_show_form.
      The config flow tests are missing adding a duplicate entry test.

    comment:
      The `test_async_setup_entry` should test the state of the mock config entry, instead of an entity state
      The `test_availability` doesn't really do what it says it does, and this is now already tested via the snapshot tests.
