      * Remove integration setup from the config flow init test
      * Make `mock_setup_entry` a separate fixture
      * Use the mock_config_entry fixture in `test_duplicate_entry`
      * `test_duplicate_entry`: Patch `homeassistant.components.anthropic.config_flow.anthropic.resources.models.AsyncModels.list`
      * Fix docstring and name for `test_form_invalid_auth` (does not only test auth)
      * In `test_form_invalid_auth`, make sure the test run until CREATE_ENTRY to test that the flow is able to recover
