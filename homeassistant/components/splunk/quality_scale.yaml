    comment: |
      Integration has no per-entry runtime state to store. The only data in
      hass.data is a YAML entity filter bridged from async_setup to
      async_setup_entry; no platforms or other code accesses it afterward.

      Verify docs describe all config flow parameters including host, port, token, SSL settings, and entity filter. The strings.json has good data_description fields that should be reflected in documentation.

    comment: |
      Add py.typed marker to hass-splunk library, add comprehensive type hints to all functions and methods in both library and integration, use custom typed ConfigEntry, add integration to homeassistant/components/.strict-typing file, and verify mypy passes. This should be done after runtime-data is implemented.
