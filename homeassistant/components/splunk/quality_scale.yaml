      The hass-splunk library needs a public CI/CD pipeline. Add GitHub Actions workflow to https://github.com/Bre77/hass_splunk to automate lint, test, build, and publish to PyPI.

      Replace hass.data[DATA_FILTER] storage with entry.runtime_data. Create typed ConfigEntry in const.py as 'type SplunkConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[EntityFilter]', update async_setup_entry signature to use SplunkConfigEntry, replace hass.data[DATA_FILTER] assignments with entry.runtime_data, and update all references including line 236 in __init__.py.

      Verify docs describe all config flow parameters including host, port, token, SSL settings, and entity filter. The strings.json has good data_description fields that should be reflected in documentation.

      Add py.typed marker to hass-splunk library, add comprehensive type hints to all functions and methods in both library and integration, use custom typed ConfigEntry, add integration to homeassistant/components/.strict-typing file, and verify mypy passes. This should be done after runtime-data is implemented.
